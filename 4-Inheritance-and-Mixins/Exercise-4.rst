Using Inheritance and Mixins
============================

Since y'all are basically pros now, we're going to kick it up a notch. 
In this exercise you will:
1. Extend the :code:`title` class in :code:`.content`
2. Create a border-radius mixin
3. Include the mixin in two classes, :code:`.div1` and :code:`.div2`
4. Extend :code:`.div` in both :code:`.div1` and :code:`.div2`

Feel free to look back to the sass file in the first exercise if you need 
any hints!

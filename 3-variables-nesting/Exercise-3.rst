Using Variables and Nesting
===========================

There are two tasks in this exercise:

1. Add three variables, and use them in appropriate elements
2. Nest one element inside another. 

There are a few files in play here. :code:`3.scss` is a template for adding
variables and nesting.  This gets compiled into :code:`3.css`, which you can see
in your browser through :code:`index.html`.
